2. Binary Tree
   /**

    * level order traversal
    * count nodes
    * sum of nodes
    * height of the tree
    * search operation
    * max element in BT
    * min element in BT
    * equality of two BTs
    * copy of tree

3. Binary Search Tree
  /**
   * insert
   * delete
   * search
   * max
   * min
   * remove all leaf
   * print in range
   * print root to leaf node path
